# Bolti Plan Usage

A vagrant file that will launch two machines and orchestrate tasks between them. Bolt actions are listed below

1. For any new machine provisioned, it will add an entry to the `/etc/hosts` to all running machines
2. For any machine destroyed, it will remove the host entry for the node from the `/etc/hosts` on all running machines.

This example multi machine use case shows how to use bolt to run bolt plans and tasks on multiple machines when they are provisioned. This simple example allows for managing the `/etc/hosts` entries across multiple machines without the use of a vagrant plugin.

When provisioning a server, the bolt plan from the `modules` directory is called to manage the hosts on all of the nodes. It generates the host entry from the `ip` address hostname inside the virtual machine. More information on how to write tasks and plans can be found in the [bolt documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/writing_tasks_and_plans.html).

Confirming the `/etc/hosts` have been updated:

~~~
âžœ  vagrant bolt command run 'grep server /etc/hosts' -n all
